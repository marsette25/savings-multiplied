###Part 1
Inside the doc folder in this repository you will find two files:  auction-page.png and home-page.png.  Imagine that you have been handed these two files to you by a designer.  It is your task as a web designer to build these two pages using ONLY html and CSS.  

Since these pages have been approved by a client it is important that your html pages look EXACTLY the same as the two mockups you have been given.  You will find all of the images needed in the images folder.  Do your best at matching colors.

At minimum you should create the following files:

1. home.html 
2. auction.html
3. home.css
4. auction.css


For now do not worry about:

1. Any of the auction items on the auction-page.png page.  You will do these in Part 2.  Only do the top bar and left bar.
2. Links - none of your links/nav bar items should work.


Technologies you should use:

1. HTML
2. CSS
